/**
 * AsyncStorage-backed `ConnectStorage` for Stellar AppKit on React Native.
 *
 * Core's default storage is `localStorage` — which doesn't exist on React
 * Native, silently turning every write into a no-op (sessions never persist).
 * Pass this adapter instead:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
 * import { createAsyncStorage } from '@saganta/stellar-appkit-react-native';
 *
 * const appkit = new StellarAppKit({
 *   network: 'TESTNET',
 *   storage: createAsyncStorage(AsyncStorage),
 *   ...
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * `ConnectStorage`'s three methods may return Promises by design, so an
 * async adapter is a first-class citizen — no polling, no shimming
 * `global.localStorage`.
