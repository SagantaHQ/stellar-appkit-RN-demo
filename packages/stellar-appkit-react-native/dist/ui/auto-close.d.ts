/**
 * Auto-close on successful operation completion — the mobile deep-link UX.
 *
 * THE BEHAVIOR (deliberate RN deviation from the web modal, documented in
 * ARCHITECTURE.md): when a wallet was opened *by the app* — a connect the
 * modal drove (wallet list tap → deep-link handoff → approval in the wallet
 * app) or a sign request the wallet answered — and that operation completes
 * SUCCESSFULLY, the sheet closes itself. No extra dismissal tap, no
 * "connected" view sitting on top of the thing the user was doing.
 * Success is the ONLY trigger: failures, rejections and expiries never
 * auto-close (web error-routing parity — the user reads the outcome and
 * acts on it).
 *
 * On mobile this is the pattern every native flow uses (Solana Mobile
 * Adapter, WalletConnect's own mobile linking): the user just confirmed in
 * the wallet app, so the round trip is *done* — the fastest path back to
 * the app is the sheet closing itself. On web the modal intentionally stays
 * open on the account view (the connected panel with balance/history is a
 * feature there); RN keeps that panel one `openAppKit()` away, it just
 * doesn't park itself in front of the app after an operation resolves.
 * (Foregrounding the app itself when the user is still sitting in the
 * wallet app is a separate feature — focus-return.ts.)
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS "SUCCESS" (arming — see AppKitModal.tsx):
 * - a modal-driven connect settles (`finishConnect` — the connect promise
 *   resolved; covers the deep-link return from HOT Wallet / Freighter / …
 *   and the Albedo WebView screen)
 * - the sign queue drains from the signing view with no error
 * SIWS phases do not re-arm anything: the connect arm survives them, so the
 * sheet closes once after the *whole* connect+sign-in flow finishes (and a
 * `siws-error` view never auto-closes — the user is reading it).
 *
 * WHAT NEVER AUTO-CLOSES (web parity — the user must see the outcome):
 * - failed connects (connecting view's error variant) and rejected signs
 *   (signing view's error variant with Cancel / Try again) — including
 *   expired WalletConnect requests and every other error outcome
 * - the generic error and network-mismatch views
 * - a preview awaiting the user's decision, and anything the user navigated
 *   to themselves (switch wallet, back arrow, disconnect, SIWS cancel) —
 *   those disarm the flag: taking control means keeping control
 *
 * THE ARMED-FLAG LIFECYCLE: armed is set only at completion sites while the
 * sheet is open, and reset on every sheet open/close transition — so a modal
 * re-opened later for account management can never self-close off a stale
 * completion, and a sheet the app force-closed mid-flow leaves nothing
 * armed behind.
 */
/**
 * How long the account view stays up after a successful operation before
 * the sheet minimizes — long enough to register the "connected ✓" /
 * signed flash (the wallet app itself already showed the success state),
 * short enough to feel like focus simply returned to the app.
